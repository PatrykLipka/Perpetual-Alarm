# Perpetual-Alarm
It's an android application, which is supposed to help you set repeating/perpetual alarms, you use it by setting the desired delay
in the settings and optionally you can restrict the alarms to stop after a number of alarms or an exact hour. 

After everyting is set as you desired simply press Set button on the main screen of the application to set the alarm cycle. 
The application will remember the settings even after turning it off.

If you choose both restrictions then the alarm is set for the first restriction to run out, for example: 
if you choose you want your alarm to end at 22:00 and you want it to burst 5 times, with the delay of 3 hours and you start the alarm cycle at 14 the alarm will set off only on 17:00 and 20:00 because you restricted it not to play after 22:00. 

It works the same way if the amount of desired alarms runs out before the final hour of your choice.

The notification popping up when the alarm bursts is clickable and opens the main screen of the app.
